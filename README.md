# Quantum Solar Farm Energy Storage Optimization

This project aims to optimize solar farm energy storage management using Qiskit and quantum optimization algorithms. The goal is to improve efficiency, minimize costs, and reduce CO2 emissions while considering constraints such as storage capacity, maximum charge/discharge power, and grid interconnection constraints.

## Installation

1. Install [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/documentation/getting_started.html) by following the official documentation.

2. Clone the repository: ```git clone https://github.com/your_username/Quantum-Solar-Farm-Energy-Storage-Optimization.git```

3. Install additional dependencies (if any) from the requirements.txt file: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Usage

1. Modify the main.py script to adjust the problem parameters or optimization settings.

2. Run the script: ```python main.py```

3. Analyze the results and compare with existing systems.

## Data

Place the input data files (solar irradiance, weather data, energy demand data, electricity market prices, and CO2 emissions factors) in the data folder. The code assumes CSV format, but you can adjust the data loading functions if needed.
