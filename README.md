# Quantum Solar Farm Energy Storage Optimization

This project aims to optimize solar farm energy storage management using Qiskit and quantum optimization algorithms. The goal is to improve efficiency, minimize costs, and reduce CO2 emissions while considering constraints such as storage capacity, maximum charge/discharge power, and grid interconnection constraints.

## Installation

1. Install [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/documentation/getting_started.html) by following the official documentation.

2. Clone the repository: ```https://github.com/jaykomarraju/Quantum-Optimization-for-Solar-Farm.git```

3. Install additional dependencies (if any) from the requirements.txt file: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Usage

- The paper and relevant code is in the format of a notebook and can be found at: [Notebook](solar-farm-optimization.ipynb)

## Data

Place the input data files (solar irradiance, weather data, energy demand data, electricity market prices, and CO2 emissions factors) in the data folder. The code assumes CSV format, but you can adjust the data loading functions if needed.
